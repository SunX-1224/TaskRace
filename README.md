# Taskrace

TaskRace is the application version of the idea of a 'todo-system' which can increase the productivity by featuring the effective division of task and a 'reward system' of increasing ranks to further motivate for completion of task in time.

Tasks are divided according to their status and also contains fields for some useful details for the task.

* TODO : tasks to be done
* FOCUS : tasks being focused now
* DONE : completed tasks

Notification system is there to remind about the task according to its importance.

**In order to improve the productivity and motivate users towards being punctual, there is a title-reward system in the app. Different titles are awarded to the users if the user accomplishes many tasks in time. Points are awarded according to the priority of the task.**


# How-To-Use

**STATUS-OF-TASK**
* TODO : It is where you can add a new task. You can slide a task-card to right to move it into FOCUSED section. (All the elements of a task are explained below)

* FOCUSED : You can move a task into this section to focus on that task. Once a task is in this section, throughout the time until the task deadline is reached or its assigned interval is crossed, you will get reminders about time remaining to complete the task few times based on the priority of the task.

* Done : After you complete the task, you can slide the task to this section which holds all the task you've accomplished. You can slide the task to right to delete it if you want.

**ELEMENTS**

Title : Title of the task (Default : Task#x)
Description : Description about the task (Default : None)
Priority : Priority level of the task (Used to set frequency of the notification)
Time :
    Interval : Target time interval for task to accomplish in
    Deadline : Deadline for the task to complete

**SUGGESTIONS-FOR-USE**

* Keep the title short and informative
  
* Add important and forgettable things in description for easy reminder later
  
* Choose the priority appropriately according to task or (use it according to number of reminders needed :: normal : 2, important : 3 - 4, very important : 4 - 5)

* Use time mode cleverly as need or if indecisible use 'Interval' for relatively short task (in range of days)and 'Deadline' for long task (months, years)
  
* Notification ringtone can be set as your like from application's setting page (Long press on app's icon on main menu to open it). 

You can also turn off notifications form here if you don't want to get reminded about your tasks.
